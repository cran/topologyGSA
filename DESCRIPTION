Title: Gene Set Analysis Exploiting Pathway Topology
Author: Sofia Massa, Gabriele Sales
Maintainer: Gabriele Sales <gabriele.sales@unipd.it>
Description: Using Gaussian graphical models we propose a novel approach to
             perform pathway analysis using gene expression. Given the
             structure of a graph (a pathway) we introduce two statistical
             tests to compare the mean and the concentration matrices between
             two groups. Specifically, these tests can be performed on the
             graph and on its connected components (cliques).
